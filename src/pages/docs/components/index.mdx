# Introduction

<br />

Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

<br />
**This is NOT a component library.** It's a collection of re-usable components that
you can copy and paste into your apps.
<br />
### What do you mean by not a component library?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

<br />
Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize
to your needs. The code is yours.
<br />
Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.

## Components
